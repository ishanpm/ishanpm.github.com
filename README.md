Maybe you want to check out my [LD37 game](/upwards), or its [post-competition version](/upwards_post)? My [itch.io page](https://woofmao.itch.io/downgrade) has some of my other LD games.


Or, perhaps, you'd like to see my [colorful AI ecosystem](/color-ai).

[This page](/math) is currently mysterious, and will likely continue to be for a while.
