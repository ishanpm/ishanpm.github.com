Maybe you'd like to see my LD42 game, [PolyPack](/polypack)? I've made [a few more games](https://ldjam.com/users/mao/games) for Ludum Dare.

Or, perhaps, you'd like to see my [colorful AI ecosystem](/color-ai).

Here's a little [Monte Carlo board game AI](/montecarlo) that can play a few board games. See if you can beat it at Pentago!

I made a cellular automaton called [Pulse2](https://github.com/ishanpm/pulse-ca), and then I made a [modular microprocessor unit](https://github.com/ishanpm/pulse-ca/wiki/Pulse2-processor) in that.

My [itch.io page](https://woofmao.itch.io) has some of my other games.

I also have a Scratch account. Two, actually: [Qwertyperson](https://scratch.mit.edu/users/qwertyperson/) has more finished stuff, and [murphyis2018](https://scratch.mit.edu/users/murphyis2018/) has less finished stuff. 

## Incomplete/outdated

[I'm making a programming language!](/PiCal) It's about Pi Calculus. It's mostly an experiment with how primitive you can go and still feel like you're actually programming, so don't write an OS in it (or maybe do).

[Here's a blue circle.](/linearlogicgame) What does it do? Well, you can do linear logic with it. How? No one knows. [Source code here.](https://github.com/ishanpm/linearlogicgame) (This will eventually be a game with a tutorial and instructions, but in the meantime you get no explanation whatsoever.) 

[This page](/math) contains some nonsense about lambda calculus. Eventually, it'll be a full-fledged interactive theorem prover (hopefully).

I made a game for LD37, [Upwards](/upwards) ([post-competition version](/upwards_post)),  but there's a bug that's making the collision detection way off, and I'm probably not going to fix it anytime soon.
