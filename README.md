Maybe you'd like to see my LD42 game, [PolyPack](/polypack)? I've made [a few more games](https://ldjam.com/users/mao/games) for Ludum Dare.

Or, perhaps, you'd like to see my [colorful AI ecosystem](/color-ai).

Here's a little [Monte Carlo board game AI](/montecarlo) that can play a few board games. See if you can beat it at Pentago!

I made a cellular automaton called [Pulse2](https://github.com/ishanpm/pulse-ca), and then I made a [modular microprocessor unit](https://github.com/ishanpm/pulse-ca/wiki/Pulse2-processor) in that.

Here's an [easy infinite minesweeper implementation](/easy-minesweeper) I made one afternoon. Drag your cursor over revealed cells and experience catharsis.

I made a [Zendo-themed module](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2843566251) for Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes. You can [see the manual](https://ktane.timwi.de/HTML/Zendo.html) or [try the online prototype](https://ishanpm.github.io/ktane-zendo-prototype/Zendo%20Interactive.html).

My [itch.io page](https://woofmao.itch.io) has some of my other games.

I also have a Scratch account. Two, actually: [Qwertyperson](https://scratch.mit.edu/users/qwertyperson/) has more finished stuff, and [murphyis2018](https://scratch.mit.edu/users/murphyis2018/) has less finished stuff. 

## Incomplete/outdated

I'm practicing formal proofs by writing a [list of theorems in linear logic and pi calculus.](/metamathlinear) They're two great flavors that go great together. I'm not sure if the system I'm using is consistent, but it seems interesting so far.

[I'm making a programming language!](/PiCal) It's about Pi Calculus. It's mostly an experiment with how primitive you can go and still feel like you're actually programming, so don't write an OS in it (or maybe do). Also the garbage collector is super glitchy.You may want to read the [readme.](https://github.com/ishanpm/PiCal)

[Here's a blue circle.](/linearlogicgame) What does it do? Well, you can do linear logic with it. How? No one knows. [Source code here.](https://github.com/ishanpm/linearlogicgame) (This will eventually be a game with a tutorial and instructions, but in the meantime you get no explanation whatsoever.) 

[This page](/math) contains some nonsense about lambda calculus. Eventually, it'll be a full-fledged interactive theorem prover (hopefully).

I made a game for LD37, [Upwards](/upwards) ([post-competition version](/upwards_post)),  but there's a bug that's making the collision detection way off, and I'm probably not going to fix it anytime soon.
