Maybe you want to check out my LD37 game, [Upwards](/upwards), or its [post-competition version](/upwards_post)? (There's a bug that's making the collision detection way off, but I'm probably not going to fix it anytime soon.)

There's also my LD42 game, [PolyPack](/polypack). I've made [a few more games](https://ldjam.com/users/mao/games) for Ludum Dare.

Or, perhaps, you'd like to see my [colorful AI ecosystem](/color-ai).

[This page](/math) contains some nonsense about lambda calculus. Eventually, it'll be a full-fledged interactive theorem prover (hopefully).

I made a cellular automaton called [Pulse2](https://github.com/ishanpm/pulse-ca), and then I made a [modular microprocessor unit](https://github.com/ishanpm/pulse-ca/wiki/Pulse2-processor) in that.

My [itch.io page](https://woofmao.itch.io) has some of my other games.

I also have a Scratch account. Two, actually: [Qwertyperson](https://scratch.mit.edu/users/qwertyperson/) has more finished stuff, and [murphyis2018](https://scratch.mit.edu/users/murphyis2018/) has less finished stuff.
