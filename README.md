Maybe you want to check out my [LD37 game](/upwards), or its [post-competition version](/upwards_post)?

There's also my [LD42 game](/polypack), PolyPack.

My [itch.io page](https://woofmao.itch.io) has some of my other games.

Or, perhaps, you'd like to see my [colorful AI ecosystem](/color-ai).

[This page](/math) is currently mysterious, and will likely continue to be for a while.
